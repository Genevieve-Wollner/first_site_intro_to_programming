          Fae is probably one of the oldest pieces I've ever digitally colored.
          I didn't have access to a scanner that often when I was in high school,
          so not a lot of pieces ended up in a state as complete as this.
          <br><br>
          I had a pretty mismatched understanding of anatomy at this point,
          not a strong grasp on layer blending in photoshop,
          and a fondness for the smudge tool.
          <br><br>
          I wasn't quite out of the pillow shading phase here.

          I think I titled this one "Nice to meet you!"
          I remember being incredibly proud of myself,
          thinking I had drawn this human being and this monster person with a pinpoint accuracy.
          <br><br>
          I was 17 or so and was probably ignoring just how giant I drew her head.
          <br><br>
          I actually really like the concept of this image and I may re-draw it later.

          Oh man, I was going through a vector phase of wanting to illustrate
          "kawaii" stuff. It was really easy in vectors.
          <br><br>
          For all intents and purposes this doesn't look wildly different
          from how I would've tackled this type of drawing now.
          I am confident, though, that this was not as technically clean as it could have been.
          Not that I can find this Illustrator file any more to check my work.

            College was when I discovered role playing games,
            stuff like Dungeons and Dragons, where you've got no graphics.
            <br><br>
            I developed my first Original Character for a game I was obsessed with at the time.
            This is her, you'll likely recognize her in the image below this one as well.
            Truth be told she's actually the subject of all three of these drawings!
            <br><br>
            This is again reflective of "pillow shading" a habit I am still trying to break.
            I was getting an okay understanding of depth by this point.

            As mentioned above, this is some more of my Original Character from college.
            I did some simple flat coloring over my line art.
            <br><br>
            I was doing alright at hands, but I was making some pretty bland faces.
            <br><br>
            Good thing is, having content that I was creating for led me to draw
            for most of my time in college. I was very prolific at that time, and I improved a lot.

            I was very proud of this clockwork robot when I finished it!
            I do remember how I pulled this off, making shapes and adding gradients
            with transparency to do the shines.
            <br><br>
            Were I to go back to this now,
            I'd probably have to do the same thing due to the limitations of
            the program I've been using lately. But I also know that, at the time I drew this,
            I could've used gradient mesh mapping to achieve the desired effect more cleanly.

            This is some fan art I did this year for the show
            Steven Universe. I completed it in about two nights (which is very fast for me!)
            and I even challenged myself to use only 10 colors to complete the whole piece.
            <br><br>
            I do love this piece, I think I did a good job with my textures and shading.
            If I were to critique myself I'd probably make his eyes smaller, fix his face a bit, and adjust Lion's paws.
            <br><br>
            From a technical aspect its easy to see the remarkable change I've made in 10 years!

            Speaking of change, you may not recognize her, but this is the
            same OC from my college days, revamped over years of change.
            <br><br>
            I used this as an example of line art because I have so few pieces now
            with visible line work. Also I think this is a pretty excellent example of how much more detailed I got.
            <br><br>
            This is also another great example of my improvements in texture and light.

            This is one of my more recent completed vector works.
            It isn't too complicated in a technical sense.
            <br><br>
            If I had to be honest, vector artwork is very specific, and I don't think
            I've been changing the way I use vectors since I learned them in the first place.
            Not that that's a bad thing!
